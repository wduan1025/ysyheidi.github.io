<p>Commercial Bank Competition and Risk</p>

<p>--Empirical study on 20 non-OECD countries</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>It is a hotspot for economists to discuss and reflect the relationship
between risks and competition. Till now there is no consensus among
researchers. With the unbalanced panel data of all commercial banks in
20 non-OECD countries over 2000-2014, the article tried to figure out
the relationship between competition and risk. Time variant Competition
was measured by the Panzar-Rosse H statistics and risk was measured by
rolling Z-scores. In the final regression, other macroeconomic index and
bank specific factors were considered. Results found that banks` risks
level would increase with the increase of market competition while a
relatively larger bank would be less impacted by competition.</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>

<p>After the subprime crisis of banking system in 2007, the risk management
problem attracts more attention from both bankers and policy makers
worldwide. And for everyone, banks are no longer only financial
institutes, but also an intermediate where people can acquire some
information about the macro economy.</p>

<p>A chain could be used to explain the relationship among individuals,
commercial banks and regulators. Individuals put their extra money in
banks to save and invest, in order to get the same time value of money
or even higher when withdrawn. Meanwhile, bankers act such an important
role in the reallocation of the scarce financial sources in the lending
and investing process, creating more value and providing more working
opportunities to individuals. Policy-makers levy taxes according to law,
regulate and supervise the behavior of both individuals and banks.
Especially in the developing countries, where the awareness of financing
just arises, it is easy to find that individuals are more involved in
the banking industry ever.</p>

<p>Sometimes the scale of banks becomes too huge, and influence countries
from all aspects. The argument of &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; believes that policy
makers would not let big banks go bankrupt even these banks are losing
value and hurting the interests of bank creditors and depositors.
Conversely, regulators would offer huge amount of subsidy, which are
also collect from tax payers, the individuals. In particular after the
failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008, it seems only more evident that no
big bank is allowed to collapse.</p>

<p>Critics go further on this topic. The protection from government would
not only create an unfair competition environment to small or
medium-sized banks, but also increase the vulnerability of domestic
banking system. And it could result in moral hazard in that big banks
would prefer higher risky projects for higher profits with the
protection from regulators. As to tax payers, they bear the biggest part
of loss when banks fail.</p>

<p>After the crises, policy makers have struggled to cut subsidy and tried
to find way out. The first measure is to force the biggest financial
companies to have more capital to absorb loses. The second measure is to
make it easier to close down a big bank. Duchin &amp; Sosyura (2010) ^[1]^
find that banks would take more risks when the central banks increase
the equity ratio to maintain profitability. Therefore, the effect of
those measures could not be foreseen till now.</p>

<p>Then what factor could have an influence on the risk of banks?
Intuitively, the answer is competition. When there is less competition,
less enterprises would fail. For regulators, they should strictly
control the number of banks. Nevertheless, the competition would
optimize the industry organization and structure. Same as the theory of
survival of the fittest, those banks who could survive after the fierce
competition must have more reasonable assets structure and investment
portfolio. For regulators, they should reduce the threshold and make it
easier for more productive and creative banks to entry. However, the
effect of competition on bank risk is still ambiguous. On one side,
competition would increase bank risk, but on the other side it reduces
risk. So theoretically whether bank risk increases or decreases with
competition cannot be directly answered, and leaves the question an
empirical one.</p>

<p>Hence, in order to keep watch on financial risk, it is still an
essential topic faced by regulators to increase or decrease the
competition in the banking industry. This article tries to address the
empirical relationship of competition and risk in banking industry with
the panel data of 20 non-OECD countries` commercial banks over
2000-2014 and to propose regulatory suggestions for those governors.</p>

<p>The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces related
literature, followed by the introduction and collection of the empirical
data. Section 4 illustrates the thought of model construction. In the
final part, we would interpret the empirical results further.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477925 .anchor}<strong>2. Literature Review</strong></p>

<p>The literature on the relationship between competition and risk of
commercial banks may be divided into two main streams.</p>

<p>The first stream is the &ldquo;competition stability&rdquo; hypothesis. Competition
may increase financial stability due to several reasons. First,
competition may accelerate the optimizing process of the whole economy
and thus avoid defaults. Both Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) ^[2]^ and
Beck et al (2006) ^[3]^ show that the improvement of banking
competition would decrease risks. Second, introduced by Boyd and De
Nicoló (2005) ^[4]^, it is worth discussing that less competition
among banks could then lead to higher interest rates charged on business
loans, which could raise the credit risk of borrowers due to the moral
hazard issues. Borrowers` default risk could result in more bad loans
and undermine bank stability by a larger scale. The authors argue that
the so-called loan market channel&rdquo; could eliminate the trade-off between
competition and financial stability implied by the &ldquo;deposit channel&rdquo;
implied by the franchise value paradigm. They also argue that the
increasing competition across both the loan and deposit markets could
lower loan rates, decrease borrower credit risk, and thus enhance
financial stability.</p>

<p>The second stream is the &ldquo;competition vulnerability&rdquo; hypothesis. Chan et
al. (1986) ^[5]^ find that increased competition reduced the producer
surplus that banks could earn by identifying high-quality borrowers. The
reduction in profits erodes the enthusiasm to screen potential borrowers
and, thus, overall portfolio credit risk increases. In a context of
asymmetric information, Marquez (2002) ^[6]^ shows that a relatively
higher number of banks in a market disperses the borrower-specific
information and results in both higher funding costs and greater access
to credit for low-quality borrowers. Yeyati and Micco (2003) ^[7]^
also proved that more competition (i.e., lower bank margins) leads to
more risk taking in the investment.</p>

<p>Many works try to measure competition by using the
structure-conduct-performance (SCP) paradigm and treat the concentration
as a proxy of and competition. In China, Chen and Li (2007) ^[8]^ use
the concentration and find it was negatively correlated with the risk
level. Zhou and Ouyang (2011) ^[9]^, Yang and Zhong (2013) ^[10]^
investigate on the China banking system but show opposite results.
Therefore there is still no consensus on this topic.</p>

<p>This article contributes to the literature by several aspects. Firstly,
we use the Panzar-Rosse H statistic as the indicator of competition.
Meanwhile during the sampled 15 years from 2000 to 2014, time variant is
taken into consideration to construct time-varying Panzar-Rosse H
statistics. Secondly, this article focuses on emerging and developing
countries since these countries are witnessing significant financial
liberalization. We use 20 non-OECD countries in our sample. The finding
in this paper thus may provide important policy suggestions for the
developing countries that tend to maximize the benefits from financial
liberalization.</p>

<p><strong>3. Bank data sample</strong></p>

<p>This section describes data used for this empirical study over 15 years
from 2000 to 2014 in banking competition and risk and data processing
details.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc448954552 .anchor}<strong>3.1 Bankscope data</strong></p>

<p>Data used in this paper is obtained from the database of Bankscope,
covering 2066 commercial banks in 20 non-OECD countries with standard
reporting data that facilitate comparison across different accounting
systems. The advantage of unbalanced data includes allowing to use the
information provided by raw data more greatly and avoid the bias with
small sample size of balanced data.</p>

<p>Consolidated data are preferred firstly and unconsolidated data are only
used for reference. When no consolidated data are available,
unconsolidated data are used. According to a number of selection rules,
I set priority from the most important variables and eliminate data
under special circumstances. Theoretically speaking, all chosen
financial indices, which will be introduced in more details later,
should be non-negative while the raw data may include some mistaken
values. Therefore data processing covers a process of excluding
non-positive values and taking the log. In order to eliminate those
outliers, threshold is set by 1% each country to reduce the outliers
both directions. Only after data processing, index used in the
methodology could be calculated and used for the second-stage
regression.</p>

<p>After all the procedure, our final data set includes 7875 bank-year
observations from 2066 different banks. India shows the largest number
of bank-year observations at 1022, followed by Brazil (992), Argentina
(581), China (554), and Malaysia (502).</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477927 .anchor}<strong>3.2 Macro data</strong></p>

<p>In the later part I also collect the data for some relevant macro
variables, such as the growth rate of real GDP, interest rate and
inflation rate in these 20 countries from 2000 to 2014. These data are
selected from the EIU Country database. To calculate the interest rate,
I use the lending interest rate instead of the money market rate as
nearly all the lending interest rate data are available.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477928 .anchor}<strong>4. Model construction</strong></p>

<p>This section mainly focuses on the approach to measure competition
(Panzar-Rosse H statistics) and risk measurement (Z-scores), followed by
the explanation to variables.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477929 .anchor}<strong>4.1 The Panzar-Rosse H statistics</strong></p>

<p>Introduced by Panzar and Rosse (1987) ^[11]^, the Panzar-Rosse
approach (P-R approach) measures market competition by the sum of the
elasticities of commercial banks` income to the price of input factors.
The derivation process is shown below.</p>

<p>When bank i realizes its profits maximization, its revenue and marginal
cost are equalized:</p>

<p>$$R^{&lsquo;}\left( x<em>{i},n,z</em>{i} \right) - C^{&lsquo;}\left( x<em>{i},w</em>{i},t_{i} \right) = 0$$</p>

<p>(1)</p>

<p>where x~i~ indicates the output of the banks i;</p>

<p>n indicates the number of banks;</p>

<p>w~i~ indicates the price of input factors of i th banks;</p>

<p>z~i~ denotes the vector of exogenous variables that shift the bank`s
revenue function;</p>

<p>t~i~ is the vector of exogenous variables that shift the bank`s cost
function;</p>

<p>Given constrains, profits equal to 0:</p>

<p>$$R<em>{i}^{<em>}\left( x^{</em>},n^{*},z \right) - C</em>{i}^{<em>}\left( x^{</em>},w,t \right) = 0$$</p>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>Variables marked with an asterisk (*) represent equilibrium values.</p>

<p>P-R approach measures the industry competition as H-statistics which can
be expressed by the elasticity of input prices:</p>

<p>$$H = \sum<em>{k = 1}^{m}{(\partial R</em>{i}^{<em>}/\partial w<em>{k</em>{i}})(w<em>{k</em>{i}}/R_{i}^{</em>})}$$</p>

<p>(3)</p>

<p>The empirical approach is based on the assumption that the market is
under the long-term equilibrium status. Rosse and Panzar(1987) proved
the rationality of the H-statistics. Later, Shaffer(1982) ^[12]^
redefined the definition of H-statistics more accurately through
research (Table 2):</p>

<p>Table 2</p>

<p>H-statistics definition</p>

<p>Numerical Interval                          Market Competition Test</p>

<hr />

<p>H-statistics$\  \in ( - \infty，0\rbrack$   Perfect monopoly market
  H-statistics$\  \in$ (0,1)                  Monopolistic competition market
  H-statistics = 1                            Perfect competitive market</p>

<p>If H≤0, then the market is viewed as completely monopoly market or
short-term oligopoly market. With the price of input factor w~i~
increasing, the marginal costs C&rsquo; increase as well. Meanwhile, the
equilibrium output decreases and total revenue declines. When
H$\in$(0,1), the market is in the monopolistic competition situation. In
that case, the marginal cost of the monopoly company C&rsquo; is equal to the
marginal revenue of it R&rsquo; and the average cost is also equal to the
average revenue of the company. When the marginal costs increases, the
competitors of those monopoly companies would adjust the output plan
till equilibrium, where the total revenue increases and the percentage
increased by the input price would exceed the percentage increased by
the total revenue. When H=1, the market is under perfect competitive
market or natural monopoly market. The increase of the input price would
boost the marginal costs and total revenue by the same degree.</p>

<p>According to Bikker and Haaf (2002) ^[13]^, the empirical model of P-R
approach that assumes a log-linear marginal cost function:</p>

<p>$$\ln{MC = \ \alpha<em>{0} + \alpha</em>{1}lnOUT + \sum<em>{i = 1}^{m}{\beta</em>{i}\ln\text{FIP}<em>{i} + \sum</em>{j = 1}^{p}\gamma<em>{j}\ln\text{EX}</em>{\text{COST}_{j}}}}$$</p>

<p>(4)</p>

<p>where OUT indicates the output of the bank;</p>

<p>FIP indicates the factor input prices (regarding funding, personnel
expenses and other non-interest expenses)；</p>

<p>EX~COST~ indicates other exogenous variables to the cost function (1) ;</p>

<p>Similarly, the marginal revenue function also assumes a log-linear form:</p>

<p>$$\ln\text{MR} = \delta<em>{0} + \delta</em>{1}lnOUT + \sum<em>{k = 1}^{q}\xi</em>{k}\ln\text{EX}<em>{\text{REV}</em>{k}}$$</p>

<p>(5)</p>

<p>EX~REV~ indicates variables that are related to the bank-specific demand
function. For a commercial bank which would maximize its profits,
marginal costs equal marginal revenue when at equilibrium, then the
equilibrium value for output (denoted by an asterisk):</p>

<p>$$\ln\text{OUT}^{*} = \left( \alpha<em>{0} - \delta</em>{0} + \sum<em>{i = 1}^{m}{\beta</em>{i}\ln{\text{FIP}<em>{i} +}}\sum</em>{j = 1}^{\text{mp}}{\gamma<em>{j}\ln{\text{EX}</em>{\text{COST}<em>{j}} - \sum</em>{k = 1}^{q}{\xi<em>{k}\ln\text{EX}</em>{\text{REV}_{k}}}}} \right)$$</p>

<p>$$/(\delta<em>{1} - \alpha</em>{1})$$</p>

<p>(6)</p>

<p>The reduced-form revenue equation can be obtained when satisfying
equilibrium output and the common price lever. In logarithmic, it is
(denoted by an asterisk):</p>

<p>$$\ln{p^{<em>} = \xi + ln(\sum<em>{i}^{}\text{OUT}</em>{i}^{</em>})}$$</p>

<p>(7)</p>

<p>Based on the framework, the empirical analysis could use the following
reduced-form revenue equation:</p>

<p>$$\ln{INTR = \alpha + \beta\ln{AFR + \gamma\ln{PPE + \delta\ln{PCE + \sum<em>{}^{}{\xi</em>{j}\ln{\text{BSF}_{j} + \eta}}}}}}\ln{OI + e}$$</p>

<p>(8)</p>

<p>where INTR indicates the ratio of total income to total assets;</p>

<p>AFR denotes the ratio of annual interest expenses to total liability;</p>

<p>PPE is the ratio of personnel expenses to the total assets;</p>

<p>PCE is the ratio of all physical capital expenditure and other expenses
to fixed assets;</p>

<p>OI is the ratio of other income to the total assets;</p>

<p>e indicates a stochastic error term;</p>

<p>INTR denotes interest income, AFR the average funding rate, PPE the
price of personnel expenses, PCE the price of capital expenditure, BSF
the bank-specific exogenous factors and OI the other income ratio. AFR,
PPE and PCE could ideally illustrate the unit price of the banks inputs:
funds, labor and capital. When some of these three index could not be
obtained, we could also use the approximated value and get the proxies
of these prices.</p>

<p>Panzar and Rosse (1987) construct H statistic to measure the competition
of banking industry with (8). In words, the H statistic is calculated as
the sum of the elasticities of a banks revenue with respect to the banks
prices of all input factors, which could be written as:</p>

<p>$$H = \beta + \gamma + \delta$$</p>

<p>(9)</p>

<p>In order to obtain a time variant H statistic over the time span, an
assumption should be satisfied that the competition level of banking
industry gradually converge to the long-term equilibrium level. A
continuous time-curve model is constructed as:</p>

<p>$$\ln{INTR = \alpha + (\beta\ln{AFR + \gamma\ln{PPE + \delta\ln{PCE)e^{\text{εTIME}}}}}}$$</p>

<p>$$+ \sum<em>{}^{}\xi</em>{j}\ln\text{BSF}_{J} + \eta\ln{OI + e}$$</p>

<p>(10)</p>

<p>And the H statistic is calculated as:</p>

<p>$$H = (\beta + \gamma + \delta)e^{\text{εTIME}}$$</p>

<p>(11)</p>

<p>To explain it, ε&lt;0 (ε&gt;0) indicates a decrease (increase) in
competitiveness over time. H statistic keeps constant when ε=0.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477930 .anchor}<strong>4.2 The risk measurement</strong></p>

<p>Based on Roy (1952) ^[14]^, Z-scores effectively measures the
probability of bankruptcy, or the credit risk of banks. To put it
simply, a bank would have a high probability to go broken when its
capital could not be enough to absorb losses. The stability of a bank
would increase with its return on assets and equity and decline with the
variation of return on assets. Then in terms of value, a higher value of
Z-scores indicates lower risks level and higher stability. It could be
expressed as:</p>

<p>$$Z = \frac{\text{ROA}<em>{\text{it}} + {(\frac{E}{A})}</em>{\text{it}}}{{(\widehat{\sigma})}_{\text{it}}}$$</p>

<p>(12)</p>

<p>where ROA indicates the return on assets;</p>

<p>E/A indicates the ratio of equity to assets;</p>

<p>$\widehat{\sigma}$ indicates the standard deviation of the return on
assets;</p>

<p>In the literature, to obtain time-variant Z-scores, rolling standard
deviation is often used. Due to the moving standard deviation within 3
years to calculate the z-score, the first two years observations, i.e.
2000 and 2001, have to drop so the final data set cover effective value
from 2002 to 2014.</p>

<p>To interpret, Z-scores are positively correlated with return on assets
and capital-to-assets ratio while negatively correlated with earning
volatility, i.e. the standard deviation of return on assets. Bank risks
decrease when Z-scores increase, showing a more stable condition with a
higher ability to absorb loses.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477931 .anchor}<strong>4.3 Empirical implementation</strong></p>

<p>In order to apply the P-R model to our data, the following empirical
reduced form equation is used, just like the Equation (10):</p>

<p>$$\ln\text{INTR} = \alpha + \left( \beta<em>{1}\ln\text{AFR} + \beta</em>{2}\ln\text{PPE} + \beta_{3}\ln\text{PCE} \right)e^{\text{εTIME}}$$</p>

<p>$+ \beta<em>{4}\ln\text{CDR} + \beta</em>{5}\ln\text{RPR} + \beta<em>{6}\ln\text{OI} + \beta</em>{7}\ln\text{LQD} + \beta_{8}\ln\text{TA}$+e</p>

<p>(13)</p>

<p>All those three input factor prices (AFR, PPE and PCE) cannot be
observed directly, so I use the ratio of total interest revenue to total
liabilities as a proxy for the average funding rate, the ratio of
personnel expenses to total assets as an approximation to the price of
personnel expenses and the ratio of overheads to fixed assets as a proxy
for the price of capital expenditure. Due to the lack of employment
details, personnel expenses data could not be provided at a relatively
wide range in the data set, causing a loss of some observations.
Additionally, I also include several bank specific factors into the
empirical model. CDR is the ratio of net loans to total assets, RPR is
the ratio of equity to total assets, OI indicates other income by the
ratio of other operating incomes to total assets, LQD indicates
liquidity by the ratio of liquid assets to deposits and short term
funding and TA indication total assets. All those bank specific factors
could reflect bank size, risk preference and income structure, which may
also influence bank revenue.</p>

<p>In order to calculate the Z-score, I follow the Equation (12) and
calculate the rolling standard deviation of return on assets with
observations in the past three years. Therefore, for every bank year
observation, first two years, i.e. observations in both 2000 and 2001
are dropped.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477933 .anchor}<strong>5.1 Competition in the banking industry</strong></p>

<p>H statistics is calculated as P-R model, the equation (13) to measure
the related price coefficients of every country with the unbalanced
data. The nonlinear least square could be estimated with the Stata.</p>

<p>For all 20 countries in the data set, coefficients are estimated by
Equation (13), reported in the Table 3.</p>

<p>The results show that for most countries (19 out of 20), the average
funding rate is significantly positively correlated with the revenue.
And for most cases, the average funding rate appears to be the biggest
coefficients, indicating that the price of funding affects the bank
income by the largest scale. And for all 20 countries, the price of
personnel expenses is also significantly positively correlated with the
revenue. As for price of capital expenditure, 17 countries show a
significantly positive correlation with the revenue and 2 countries show
a significantly negative correlation. Both these 2 countries could be
rejected at the 1% confidence level while all those 17 countries are
still significant even at the 1% confidence level.</p>

<p>The one-side t-test indicates that the time coefficient ε is
significantly positive for 10 countries and significantly negative for 2
countries, showing that 10 of them have an increase in competition and 2
have a decrease competition over time. As to the remaining 8 countries,
the results show that the time coefficients are not significantly even
at the 10% confidence interval, indicating that for those 8 countries
(China, Colombia, Hungary, India, Mexico, Nepal, Poland and Thailand), H
statistics should keep constant over years.</p>

<p>With all the observations in 20 countries, equation (12) calculates the
every bank-year Z-score from 2002-2014 (first two years are eliminated).
The average of all Z-scores in every year each country is shown in Graph
1. The stacked area graph would not only show the trend of banking risks
each country over time, but also show the accumulative risk level every
year. We find a general rising trend over these 13 years both for each
country and for the accumulated value, indicating that the risks
burdened by the banking industry in the non-OECD countries are actually
decreasing. However, if we looking into the graph from 2007-2009, the
subprime crisis worldwide, a general decreasing trend could be noticed.
It is reasonable since banks are faced with public confidence lose,
risks of running and a bad industrial situation during the global
financial crisis.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477935 .anchor}<strong>5.3 Empirical results of relationship
between competition and risk</strong></p>

<p>In the following section, we regress Z-scores on H statistics, with
other controlled variables, to analyze the relationship between bank
competition and risk. Here H statistics calculated by both approach
above are put into the final regression to measure the competition and
Z-scores calculated above are used to measure bank risks. The regression
equation is:</p>

<p>$Risk = c + \alpha*Competition + \beta*Bank\ Specific\ Factors + \gamma*macro\ index\ $</p>

<p>(14)</p>

<p>Due to the limitation of the data base, some bank-year observations are
missed and the final panel data set is unbalanced. If those values are
missing randomly, the fixed effects estimator can be easily extended to
our unbalanced panel. In the final regression model, not all the
individual heterogeneity could be controlled, so the fixed effect
estimators are more ideal.</p>

<p>As shown in the equation (14), we also control the effect of
macroeconomic variables on risk level of banking industry, namely real
GDP growth rate, inflation, and the first order difference of interest
rates.</p>

<p>The model with H statistics using all estimates are not consistent with
the one using only statistically significant estimates. Since the later
results consider the significance of coefficient, it is more reasonable
to use the later one. Only results of three different regression models
with H statistics in Table 5 are reported (Table 6).</p>

<p>Generally speaking, H statistics is significantly negatively correlated
with the Z-scores, suggesting that banks` risks level would increase
when market competition increase. In the third model, if H statistics
increases by 1 unit, then the bank risk would increase by 5.55 unit. The
coefficients are smallest in number in the first model, at 0.2972. To
explain it, even though competition would accelerate the evolution and
optimization of banking industry and eliminate low efficient banking
units, the new entrants could threat the intrinsic equilibrium and
imperil every individuals. Especially in our selected developing
countries and districts, economic conditions are not so stable and the
regulation systems are not so found. Any vicious competition by new
entrants would harm the banking industry by a relatively larger degree.</p>

<p>As to the size effect on the risk level, in the model 1, total assets is
significantly positively correlated with the risk level at the 1%
confidence interval while in another two models, we fail to reject the
null hypothesis that the effects are significantly different from zero.</p>

<p>To consider the marginal effect of both competition and size, we add an
interaction item of total assets and H statistic into the model. The
coefficients are significantly positive correlated with the risk level
in the last two models. Hence, as the size of the bank fixed, the effect
of competition on the risk level would exceed the effect of size on the
risk level by 0.33% (in model 2), which also indicates that a relatively
larger bank would be less impacted by competition. It could be because
banks with a larger size can have lower financing costs, allocate assets
more wisely and develop more sophisticated internal control systems.</p>

<p>Model 3 suggests a positive effect of liquidity on banks` risk level. A
bank with higher liquidity has a better performance and a lower
probability to be insolvent. Since the liquidity measures a company`s
ability to repay short-term creditors out of its total cash, a higher
liquidity helps the banks to control risk.</p>

<p>We also find that macro-economic condition also imposes significant
effects on banks` risk level. With a higher GDP growth rate, more good
investment opportunities maybe available for bankers and then help the
banks to have a more profitable investment portfolio. Increase of
difference in interest rates happens when monetary policy is
contractionary. With conservative concepts in those years, a larger part
of banks money would put as reserve, but not invest projects to gain
profits, decreasing the risk level of banking industry.</p>

<p>The coefficients of years show a significant decreasing trend on risk
level, which is in line with the trend showed in the Graph 1. In these
20 countries, the overall risks decline may be contributed by the more
comprehensive regulatory system and more rational investment decision.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc449477936 .anchor}**6. Conclusions **</p>

<p>In sum, commercial banks bear higher risk level when the competition is
more severe and big banks are safer than small and medium sized banks in
competition. At the same time, higher liquidity would help banks to
absorb losses and then avoid failing. As to the macro-economic factors,
higher GDP growth rate, higher inflation rate and more conservative
monetary policy all contribute to lower bank risks.</p>

<p>Our finding lends strong support to the evidence that bank size is a
significant factor when considering risks. Those critics on big banks
claiming that big banks should be broken up into smaller banks appear to
be not persuasive as they stand. Oppositely, a proper increase of big
banks` portion would stabilize the banking system.</p>

<p>For regulators in developing countries, evidence shows that competition
among commercial banks would enhance the probability of fails. Although
a market with less constraints would provide more opportunities, banking
industry is somehow different with other service industry since any
bankruptcy involves a large number of other enterprises and individuals.
Criteria for the entry and exit should be set and carried out
efficiently. In order to improve the overall industry ability to absorb
losses, a reasonable liquidity ratio and deposit reserve ratio could be
established. They should also keep prudent that risks are coming with
positive GDP growth rate, even though it proves a promising investment
environment. On this occasion, few control on monetary policy would be
published, also exposing banks to higher risk level.</p>

<p><strong>致谢</strong></p>

<p>大学四年的生活也许在论文定稿的时候划上句号，也许会等到领毕业证的那一天。</p>

<p>很庆幸我选择了吴季老师，吴季老师也选择了我。从十月份开始，导师便开始跟我讨论选题，而之后几乎每周一次的见面，导师都会针对我进度提出建议，为我解决数据或是模型方面的问题。在论文初稿完成之后，导师耐心地通读了我的文章，把文章中不适当的地方提出来，不仅仅是研究课题，甚至包括了英语语法问题。当我打开修改意见邮件附件的时候，全是震惊与感动。幸得此导师，也许这是我继续下段海外学习之前最后一次，得到如此细致指导的研究论文了。</p>

<p>此外，特别感谢汪嘉骏同学，在我数据处理过程中提供的MATLAB编程的帮助。如果没有他的建议，大部分数据处理我会手动采用EXCEL完成，这会为之后反复修改带来巨大的困难，耗费大量不必要的时间。</p>

<p>感谢论文写作的期间一直陪伴的朋友，感谢期间不断努力的自己。论文结束而life-long
learning并没有停止，希望自己能够勇敢地暴露在comfort
zone之外，工作之余在专业方面有更深的理解和研究，为下一段学习做好充足准备。</p>

Commercial Bank Competition and Risk
--Empirical study on 20 non-OECD countries
Abstract
It is a hotspot for economists to discuss and reflect the relationship between risks and competition. Till now there is no consensus among researchers. With the unbalanced panel data of all commercial banks in 20 non-OECD countries over 2000-2014, the article tried to figure out the relationship between competition and risk. Time variant Competition was measured by the Panzar-Rosse H statistics and risk was measured by rolling Z-scores.</div>
